Creating a Custom Docker Image

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Building custom Docker images is a fundamental skill for Docker developers. In this assignment, you will task students with creating a Dockerfile to build a custom Docker image for a specific application or service. Students will include necessary dependencies, configurations, and application code in the Dockerfile and then build the image. This hands-on exercise will help students understand the process of image creation and customization.

Assignment Objectives:

To gain practical experience in creating custom Docker images.
To understand the structure and content of Dockerfiles.
To practice including dependencies, configurations, and application code in Docker images.
Task Description:

Application Selection:
a. Assign each student or group a specific application or service that they will containerize in this assignment. Examples include a web application, a database server, or a simple "Hello World" application.
b. Ensure that the chosen application/service has specific dependencies and configurations that can be included in the Docker image.

Dockerfile Creation:
a. Instruct students to create a Dockerfile for their assigned application/service.
b. The Dockerfile should include instructions for:

Choosing a base image.
Installing any necessary dependencies.
Configuring the environment (e.g., setting environment variables).
Copying application code or files into the image.
Specifying a command to run the application or service when a container is started.
Docker Image Building:
a. Once the Dockerfile is ready, students should use the docker build command to build the Docker image based on their Dockerfile.
b. Ensure that students document the build process and any errors or warnings encountered.

Image Testing:
a. Instruct students to create and run a container using the newly built custom Docker image.
b. Students should thoroughly test the containerized application or service to ensure it works as expected.
c. Document the testing process, including any issues faced and their resolutions.

Documentation:
a. Create documentation that includes the following:

The Dockerfile for the custom image.
Detailed explanations of the Dockerfile instructions and their purpose.
Documentation of the image building process, including any encountered challenges.
Results of testing and verification, including application functionality.
Submission:
a. Compile the Dockerfile, documentation, and any relevant files into a single document (PDF or Word).

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of the Dockerfile.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Successful Docker image building and testing.
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, documentation quality).
