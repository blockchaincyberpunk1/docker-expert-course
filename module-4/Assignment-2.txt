Multi-Stage Dockerfile

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Optimizing image build processes is crucial for efficient Docker development. In this assignment, you will instruct students to create a multi-stage Dockerfile. Multi-stage builds allow developers to separate the build and runtime environments within a Dockerfile, resulting in smaller and more efficient final images. Students will learn how to use multi-stage builds to streamline the image creation process.

Assignment Objectives:

To gain practical experience in creating multi-stage Dockerfiles.
To understand the benefits of separating build and runtime environments in Docker images.
To practice optimizing image sizes and improving image build efficiency.
Task Description:

Application Selection:
a. Assign each student or group a specific application or service that they will containerize in this assignment. Examples include a web application, a database server, or a simple "Hello World" application.
b. Ensure that the chosen application or service can benefit from multi-stage builds by separating the build and runtime environments.

Multi-Stage Dockerfile Creation:
a. Instruct students to create a multi-stage Dockerfile for their assigned application or service.
b. The Dockerfile should include two or more stages, with clear separation between the build and runtime environments.
c. The build stage should:

Use a base image suitable for building the application.
Install build-time dependencies.
Compile, build, or package the application.
d. The runtime stage should:
Use a smaller base image suitable for running the application.
Copy the built application artifacts from the build stage.
Configure the runtime environment, such as setting environment variables.
Specify a command to run the application.
Docker Image Building:
a. Once the multi-stage Dockerfile is ready, students should use the docker build command to build the Docker image based on their Dockerfile.
b. Ensure that students document the build process and any errors or warnings encountered.

Image Testing:
a. Instruct students to create and run a container using the newly built custom Docker image.
b. Students should thoroughly test the containerized application or service to ensure it works as expected.
c. Document the testing process, including any issues faced and their resolutions.

Documentation:
a. Create documentation that includes the following:

The multi-stage Dockerfile for the custom image.
Detailed explanations of the Dockerfile stages, instructions, and their purpose.
Documentation of the image building process, including any encountered challenges.
Results of testing and verification, including application functionality.
Submission:
a. Compile the multi-stage Dockerfile, documentation, and any relevant files into a single document (PDF or Word).

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of the multi-stage Dockerfile.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Successful Docker image building and testing.
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, documentation quality).
