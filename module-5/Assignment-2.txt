Deploying a Basic Service in Docker Swarm

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Deploying services in a Docker Swarm cluster is a fundamental aspect of container orchestration. In this assignment, students will be tasked with deploying a basic application service (e.g., a web server) in a Docker Swarm cluster. They will create a Docker Compose file for the service, deploy it to the cluster, and ensure high availability by leveraging Swarm's capabilities.

Assignment Objectives:

To gain hands-on experience in deploying services in a Docker Swarm cluster.
To understand the use of Docker Compose for defining and deploying services.
To practice ensuring high availability and load balancing in a Swarm cluster.
Task Description:

Docker Swarm Cluster Setup:
a. Ensure that students have access to a Docker Swarm cluster consisting of manager and worker nodes. Refer to the "Setting Up a Docker Swarm Cluster" assignment for the cluster setup.

Basic Service Selection:
a. Assign each student or group a basic application service to deploy within the Swarm cluster. Examples include a web server, a database, or a message queue.
b. Ensure that the chosen service has a Docker Compose configuration suitable for deployment.

Docker Compose File Creation:
a. Instruct students to create a Docker Compose file for the selected service. The Compose file should define the service, including container configuration, ports, replicas, and any necessary environment variables.
b. Encourage students to include the necessary specifications for high availability, such as the "replicas" option.

Service Deployment:
a. Guide students through the deployment of the service to the Docker Swarm cluster using the Docker Compose file. They should use the docker stack deploy command for this purpose.
b. Ensure that students document the deployment process and provide the Compose file they used.

High Availability Verification:
a. Instruct students to verify the high availability and load balancing capabilities of the deployed service. They should:

Check the status and distribution of service replicas across worker nodes.
Verify that the service is accessible via the cluster's load balancer.
Demonstrate the resilience of the service by scaling it up or down and observing the behavior.
Documentation:
a. Create documentation that includes the following:

The Docker Compose file used for deploying the service.
Detailed explanations of the service configuration within the Compose file.
Documentation of the service deployment process, including any encountered challenges.
Verification of high availability and load balancing in the Swarm cluster.
Submission:
a. Compile the documentation from each student or group into a single document (PDF or Word) for submission.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Accurate and complete deployment of the service using Docker Compose.
Successful verification of high availability and load balancing.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, documentation quality).
