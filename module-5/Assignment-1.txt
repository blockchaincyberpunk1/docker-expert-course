Setting Up a Docker Swarm Cluster

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Docker Swarm is a powerful container orchestration tool that allows for the creation of clusters to manage containers across multiple nodes. In this assignment, students will learn how to set up a Docker Swarm cluster consisting of manager and worker nodes. They will document the steps involved in initializing the swarm, joining nodes, and verifying the cluster's status, providing them with hands-on experience in cluster creation and management.

Assignment Objectives:

To gain practical experience in setting up a Docker Swarm cluster.
To understand the concepts of manager and worker nodes in a Swarm cluster.
To practice initializing a swarm, joining nodes, and verifying cluster status.
Task Description:

Environment Preparation:
a. Ensure that students have access to multiple virtual machines or cloud instances that will serve as the nodes for their Docker Swarm cluster.
b. Verify that Docker is installed and properly configured on each node.

Swarm Initialization:
a. Assign one student or group to be the Swarm manager. Instruct them to initialize the Docker Swarm by using the docker swarm init command on the manager node.
b. Document the output of the docker swarm init command, which includes a token for worker nodes to join the swarm.

Joining Worker Nodes:
a. Assign other students or groups as worker nodes. Instruct them to join the Swarm cluster using the token obtained from the manager's docker swarm init output.
b. Document the steps involved in joining worker nodes to the swarm.

Verifying Swarm Status:
a. Instruct all students to verify the status of the Docker Swarm cluster by running appropriate Docker commands.
b. They should check the status of manager and worker nodes, as well as inspect the swarm services and networks to ensure they are correctly configured.

Cluster Documentation:
a. Each student or group should create documentation that includes the following:

The steps they followed to initialize the Docker Swarm on the manager node.
The steps taken by worker nodes to join the swarm.
Screenshots or logs showing the successful initialization and joining of nodes.
Output of commands used to verify the swarm status, including manager and worker nodes, services, and networks.
Cluster Testing (Optional):
a. As an optional extension to the assignment, students can deploy a simple service on the Docker Swarm cluster to test its functionality. This can include creating a service, scaling it, and accessing it.

Submission:
a. Compile the documentation from each student or group into a single document (PDF or Word) for submission.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Accurate and complete documentation of swarm initialization and node joining.
Successful verification of the swarm status.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Optional testing of the swarm cluster (if performed).
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, documentation quality).
