Rolling Updates with Docker Swarm

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Performing rolling updates in a Docker Swarm cluster is essential to maintain application availability while applying changes. In this assignment, students will learn how to implement rolling updates for a service in a Docker Swarm cluster. They will modify the service's Docker image, trigger an update, and ensure zero downtime during the update process, gaining valuable experience in managing updates in a production-like environment.

Assignment Objectives:

To gain hands-on experience in performing rolling updates using Docker Swarm.
To understand the concept of rolling updates and their importance for application availability.
To practice modifying Docker Compose files and managing service updates.
Task Description:

Docker Swarm Cluster Setup:
a. Ensure that students have access to a Docker Swarm cluster with manager and worker nodes. Refer to the "Setting Up a Docker Swarm Cluster" assignment for cluster setup.

Service Selection:
a. Assign each student or group a service that is currently deployed within the Swarm cluster. This service should have a Docker Compose configuration and be running with the current Docker image.
b. Verify that the chosen service is suitable for demonstrating rolling updates (e.g., a web application, a microservice).

Docker Compose File Review:
a. Instruct students to review the Docker Compose file of the selected service. They should analyze the current configuration, including the Docker image version and any other relevant parameters.

Docker Image Update:
a. Guide students through the process of updating the Docker image for the selected service. They should modify the Docker Compose file to use a new version of the image.
b. Ensure that students document the changes made to the Compose file, including the new image version.

Rolling Update Trigger:
a. Instruct students to trigger a rolling update for the service using the docker service update command. They should specify the service name and image version to update to.
b. Emphasize the importance of the "update-delay" option to control the rate of updates and minimize downtime.

Monitoring and Verification:
a. Ask students to monitor the update progress by checking the status of the service replicas and tasks.
b. Ensure that they verify that the update is performed with zero downtime and that the new version of the service is fully operational.

Documentation:
a. Create documentation that includes the following:

The original Docker Compose file for the service.
Details of the modifications made to the Compose file for the update.
Documentation of the rolling update process, including the commands used.
Verification of zero downtime and the functionality of the updated service.
Submission:
a. Compile the documentation from each student or group into a single document (PDF or Word) for submission.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Accurate and successful execution of the rolling update.
Verification of zero downtime and service functionality.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, documentation quality).
