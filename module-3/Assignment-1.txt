Docker Compose Basics

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Docker Compose simplifies the process of defining and running multi-container applications. In this assignment, you will get started with Docker Compose by creating a simple Docker Compose file. Your task is to define and run a multi-container application with two services, such as a web application and a database. You will document the setup, including service definitions and networking configuration.

Assignment Objectives:

To gain hands-on experience with Docker Compose.
To understand the structure of a Docker Compose file and how it defines multi-container applications.
To practice configuring services and networking in Docker Compose.
Task Description:

Multi-Container Scenario:
a. Define a simple multi-container scenario that requires the use of two services. For example, you can have a web application container that depends on a database container.

Docker Compose File:
a. Create a Docker Compose YAML file that defines the services and networking for your multi-container application.
b. Define two services within the Compose file: one for the web application and one for the database.
c. Configure the services with appropriate settings, including image names, ports, environment variables, and dependencies.
d. Specify a custom network for the containers to ensure they can communicate.

Service Configuration:
a. Document the configuration details for each service, including:

Image: Specify the Docker image to use for each service.
Ports: Define the ports to expose for each service.
Environment Variables: Set any environment variables required for the services to function correctly.
Dependencies: Ensure that the web application service depends on the database service.
Networking Configuration:
a. Explain the networking configuration within your Docker Compose file, including how containers can communicate with each other.
b. Ensure that the containers in your scenario can communicate successfully.

Docker Compose Execution:
a. Use the docker-compose up command to launch your multi-container application based on the Docker Compose file.
b. Verify that all services are running without errors and can interact as expected.

Testing and Documentation:
a. Test the functionality of your multi-container application by interacting with the web application and database.
b. Document your experience, including any challenges faced and how you resolved them.

Submission:
a. Compile your Docker Compose YAML file and documentation into a single document (PDF or Word).

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of the Docker Compose YAML file.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Successful deployment and functionality testing of the multi-container application.
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, documentation quality).
