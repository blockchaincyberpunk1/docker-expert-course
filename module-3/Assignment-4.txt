Inter-Container Communication

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Inter-container communication is a fundamental aspect of containerized applications, especially in microservices architectures. In this assignment, you will practice inter-container communication by creating a multi-container application using Docker Compose. Your task is to design a scenario where one service communicates with another within the same Compose network. You will demonstrate how containers interact and share data in this networked environment.

Assignment Objectives:

To gain practical experience in inter-container communication within Docker Compose networks.
To understand how containers can interact and share data in a multi-container setup.
To design a scenario that highlights the importance of inter-container communication in microservices architectures.
Task Description:

Scenario Design:
a. Define a multi-container scenario that reflects a microservices architecture or any other situation where inter-container communication is essential. For example, you can create a scenario with a front-end web application communicating with a back-end API service.

Docker Compose Configuration:
a. Create a Docker Compose YAML file that defines the services, networks, and volumes required for your multi-container application.
b. Set up a custom Docker network within the Compose file to facilitate communication between the services.
c. Define the services in your Compose file, ensuring that each service is isolated within its own container.

Service Configuration:
a. Document the configuration details for each service, including environment variables and network settings.
b. Specify how services interact with each other. For example, if one service depends on another, describe this dependency in the Compose file.

Docker Compose Execution:
a. Use the docker-compose up command to launch your multi-container application based on the Docker Compose file.
b. Verify that all services start without errors and that the containers can communicate within the custom network.

Testing and Verification:
a. Test the functionality of your multi-container application by simulating interactions between the services. For example, if you have a front-end and back-end service, test API requests from the front-end to the back-end.
b. Document the results of your testing and verify that the containers are successfully communicating.

Documentation:
a. Create documentation that includes the following:

Your Docker Compose YAML file with network and service definitions.
Detailed explanations of how inter-container communication is facilitated within the Compose setup.
Results of your testing and verification, including any issues encountered and their resolutions.
Reflection on the importance of inter-container communication in microservices architectures.
Submission:
a. Compile your Docker Compose YAML file and documentation into a single document (PDF or Word).

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of Docker Compose configuration for inter-container communication.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Successful deployment and functionality testing of the multi-container application.
Reflection on the importance of inter-container communication in microservices architectures.
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, documentation quality).
