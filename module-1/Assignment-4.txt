Docker Container Basics

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Understanding the fundamentals of Docker containers is essential for any Docker developer. In this assignment, you will get hands-on experience creating a simple Docker container. You will write a Dockerfile, build an image, and run a container using a provided application or a basic web server. This practical exercise will help you grasp core Docker concepts and prepare you for more advanced containerization tasks.

Assignment Objectives:

To gain practical experience in creating Docker containers.
To understand the structure and components of a Dockerfile.
To become proficient in building Docker images and running containers.
Task Description:

Application Selection:
a. You can choose one of the following options:

Option 1: Use a provided application (specified by your instructor).
Option 2: Use a basic web server application (e.g., Nginx or Apache).
Docker Container Creation:
a. Write a Dockerfile that specifies the configuration for your container. Include any necessary instructions for setting up your chosen application within the container.
b. Pay attention to important Dockerfile elements, such as base image selection, installation of dependencies, and application setup.
c. Document your Dockerfile with comments explaining each step and its purpose.

Building the Docker Image:
a. Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile you created in the previous step. Use the docker build command.
b. Verify that the image is successfully built by running docker images and providing the output.

Running the Docker Container:
a. Run a Docker container based on the image you built in step 3. Use the docker run command.
b. Ensure that the container is up and running.
c. Access the application within the container, either through a web browser (if applicable) or by examining container logs.

Documentation and Reflection:
a. Document your experience throughout the process. Include any challenges you faced and how you resolved them.
b. Reflect on the importance of each Dockerfile instruction and how it contributes to the final container.
c. Provide screenshots or terminal/command prompt outputs as needed to illustrate your work.

Submission:
a. Compile your documentation, Dockerfile, and any relevant screenshots into a single document (PDF or Word).

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of the Dockerfile.
Successful building and running of the Docker container.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Reflection on the Dockerfile instructions and their significance.
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, screenshots).
