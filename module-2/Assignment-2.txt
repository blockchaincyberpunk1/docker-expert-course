Docker Compose

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Docker Compose is a powerful tool for defining and managing multi-container applications. In this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience with Docker Compose by orchestrating a multi-container application. You will be provided with a sample application composed of multiple services, such as a web application and a database. Your task is to write a Docker Compose file to define and manage these containers effectively.

Assignment Objectives:

To understand the role of Docker Compose in managing multi-container applications.
To gain practical experience in defining and orchestrating containers using Docker Compose.
To work with services, networks, and volumes in a Docker Compose setup.
Task Description:

Sample Application:
a. You will be provided with a sample multi-container application. This application may include services like a web application, a database, and possibly others.
b. Familiarize yourself with the components of the sample application and how they interact.

Docker Compose File:
a. Write a Docker Compose YAML file that defines the services, networks, and volumes required for the multi-container application.
b. Define the following in your Docker Compose file:

Services: Specify the services required for the application (e.g., web app, database).
Networks: Create a custom Docker network to enable communication between the services.
Volumes: Define any necessary volumes for data persistence.
c. Configure the services, networks, and volumes according to the sample application's requirements.
Launching the Multi-Container Application:
a. Use Docker Compose to bring up the entire application stack defined in your Docker Compose file. Use the docker-compose up command.
b. Ensure that all services start without errors, and there are no issues with connectivity.

Testing and Verification:
a. Access the application's web interface (if applicable) and perform basic operations to verify that it is functioning correctly.
b. Document any challenges you encounter and the steps taken to resolve them.

Documentation:
a. Create documentation that includes the following:

Your Docker Compose YAML file.
A brief description of the multi-container application and its components.
Instructions for launching the application using Docker Compose.
Any issues or challenges faced during the setup and how you addressed them.
Submission:
a. Compile your documentation and Docker Compose file into a single document (PDF or Word).

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of the Docker Compose YAML file.
Successful deployment and operation of the multi-container application.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Testing and verification of the application.
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, documentation quality).
