Docker Volumes vs. Mounts

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Managing data effectively in Docker containers is crucial for many applications. Docker provides two primary mechanisms for data sharing between containers: volumes and mounts. In this assignment, you will explore these two approaches by designing a scenario where data needs to be shared between containers. You will create Docker containers that use both volumes and mounts and discuss the differences in data management.

Assignment Objectives:

To gain practical experience in using Docker volumes and mounts for data management.
To understand the advantages and differences between Docker volumes and mounts.
To be able to select the appropriate data management approach for specific container scenarios.
Task Description:

Scenario Design:
a. Define a scenario in which multiple containers need to share data or access the same data source. For example, you can create a scenario where a web server container needs access to a configuration file stored outside the container.

Docker Volumes:
a. Create a Docker container that uses Docker volumes to manage data.
b. Specify a volume in your Docker Compose file or Docker run command.
c. Include a process that writes or reads data to/from the volume within your container.
d. Document the steps taken to set up and use Docker volumes in your scenario.

Docker Mounts:
a. Create a second Docker container that uses Docker mounts to manage data.
b. Configure a bind mount or a named volume mount to share data between containers.
c. Include a process in this container that interacts with the shared data source (e.g., reads or modifies the data).
d. Document the steps taken to set up and use Docker mounts in your scenario.

Data Interaction and Comparison:
a. Run both containers (from step 2 and step 3) in your Docker environment.
b. Test the data interaction between containers to ensure that data is being shared as expected.
c. Document the results of your tests and any observations regarding data management with volumes and mounts.

Discussion and Analysis:
a. Compare the advantages and differences between Docker volumes and mounts.
b. Discuss when it is more appropriate to use volumes and when to use mounts based on your scenario.
c. Reflect on the potential use cases for each approach and the implications for data persistence and container portability.

Documentation:
a. Create documentation that includes the following:

A description of your scenario and its data sharing requirements.
Detailed instructions for setting up and using Docker volumes and mounts.
Results of your data interaction tests.
A comparative analysis of volumes and mounts, including advantages and use cases.
Recommendations for choosing the appropriate data management approach.
Submission:
a. Compile your documentation into a single document (PDF or Word).

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of Docker volume and mount configuration.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Analysis of the advantages and differences between volumes and mounts.
Recommendations for selecting the appropriate data management approach.
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, documentation quality).
