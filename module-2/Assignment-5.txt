Data Backup and Restore

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Data backup and restore operations are crucial skills for Docker developers, ensuring data integrity and recoverability. In this assignment, you will practice these operations by working with a Docker container that stores data (e.g., a database container). Your task is to create a script or set of Docker commands to back up the data, destroy the container, and then restore the data to a new container. This practical exercise will help you become proficient in safeguarding and recovering data in Dockerized environments.

Assignment Objectives:

To gain practical experience in data backup and restore operations within Docker containers.
To understand the importance of data persistence and recovery in containerized applications.
To become proficient in creating backup and restore procedures for containerized data.
Task Description:

Provided Docker Container:
a. You will be provided with a Docker container that stores data. The container may contain a database or any other data storage service.
b. Familiarize yourself with the container and its data storage mechanism.

Data Backup Procedure:
a. Create a script or set of Docker commands to back up the data stored within the provided container.
b. Specify the backup destination, such as a local directory or another container, and ensure that the data is securely stored.

Container Destruction:
a. Destroy the provided Docker container that stores the data. Use the appropriate Docker command to remove the container.

Data Restore Procedure:
a. Create a script or set of Docker commands to restore the previously backed-up data to a new Docker container.
b. Ensure that the restored data is functional and that the container is correctly configured to use it.

Testing and Verification:
a. Test the functionality of the new container with the restored data. Verify that the data is intact and that the container operates as expected.
b. Document any challenges you faced during the backup and restore process and how you addressed them.

Documentation:
a. Create documentation that includes the following:

A description of the provided Docker container and its data storage mechanism.
Detailed backup and restore procedures, including scripts or Docker commands used.
Results of your data restoration tests.
A reflection on the importance of data persistence and recovery in Docker environments.
Submission:
a. Compile your documentation and backup/restore scripts or commands into a single document (PDF or Word).

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of backup and restore procedures.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Successful data restoration and functionality testing.
Reflection on the importance of data persistence and recovery in Docker environments.
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, documentation quality).
