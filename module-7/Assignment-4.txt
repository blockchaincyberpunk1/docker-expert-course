Blue-Green Deployment with Docker

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Blue-Green Deployment is a deployment strategy that allows for the seamless release of new versions of an application with zero downtime. In this assignment, students will practice implementing a Blue-Green Deployment strategy for a Dockerized application. They will create two sets of containers (blue and green), update one set with a new version of the application, and demonstrate the ability to switch traffic to the updated version without causing disruption.

Assignment Objectives:

To understand the concepts and benefits of Blue-Green Deployment.
To gain hands-on experience in implementing a Blue-Green Deployment strategy using Docker containers.
To practice managing the transition of traffic from one version of an application to another with zero downtime.
Task Description:

Introduction to Blue-Green Deployment:
a. Provide an introduction to the Blue-Green Deployment strategy, emphasizing its role in ensuring uninterrupted application updates.
b. Explain the key concepts of blue and green environments.

Sample Application:
a. Provide students with a sample Dockerized application (e.g., a web application) and its source code.
b. Ensure that the application can be scaled horizontally by deploying multiple containers.

Docker Compose File Creation:
a. Instruct students to create a Docker Compose file that defines the application's services and dependencies.
b. Encourage them to design the Compose file in a way that supports Blue-Green Deployment, allowing for separate blue and green environments.

Blue-Green Environment Setup:
a. Guide students in setting up the initial blue environment with a certain version of the application.
b. Instruct them to ensure that the environment-specific configurations are correctly defined for the blue environment.

Deployment of Green Environment:
a. Ask students to create a green environment with an updated version of the application.
b. Encourage them to make necessary changes to the Docker Compose file, environment variables, or other configuration files to distinguish between the blue and green environments.

Traffic Switching:
a. Instruct students to demonstrate how they can switch traffic from the blue environment to the green environment with zero downtime.
b. Explain the techniques they are using (e.g., load balancer configuration, DNS changes, or other strategies).

Verification and Testing:
a. Encourage students to verify that the green environment serves traffic seamlessly after the switch.
b. Ask them to test the deployment strategy by rolling back to the blue environment and ensuring a smooth transition.

Documentation:
a. Require students to create documentation that includes:

The Docker Compose file.
Configuration details for the blue and green environments.
Steps for implementing Blue-Green Deployment.
Verification and testing results.
Presentation (Optional):
a. Depending on your course format, students can either present their Blue-Green Deployment setup and findings to the class or submit their documentation as instructed.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Effective implementation of Blue-Green Deployment using Docker containers.
Successful traffic switching without downtime.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Optional presentation (if performed).
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, content quality).
