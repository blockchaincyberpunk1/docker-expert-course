Deploying Microservices with Docker Swarm

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Microservices architecture is a popular approach to building scalable and modular applications. In this assignment, students will gain practical experience by deploying a microservices-based application using Docker Swarm. They will design a scenario with multiple microservices, create a Docker Compose file for deployment, and demonstrate how to manage and scale these microservices within the Swarm cluster.

Assignment Objectives:

To understand the principles and benefits of microservices architecture.
To gain hands-on experience in deploying microservices using Docker Swarm.
To practice managing and scaling microservices within a Swarm cluster.
Task Description:

Introduction to Microservices and Docker Swarm:
a. Provide an introduction to microservices architecture, explaining its modularity and scalability advantages.
b. Explain how Docker Swarm can be used to orchestrate and manage microservices.

Microservices Scenario Design:
a. Instruct students to design a microservices-based application scenario that includes multiple microservices with interdependencies.
b. Ensure that the scenario represents real-world microservices communication patterns (e.g., RESTful APIs).

Docker Compose File Creation:
a. Guide students through the process of creating a Docker Compose file that defines the microservices, their dependencies, and any required networks.
b. Encourage them to consider the use of Docker Compose features for specifying service configurations, networks, and volumes.

Swarm Cluster Setup:
a. Instruct students to set up a Docker Swarm cluster with at least one manager and multiple worker nodes.
b. Ensure that they have a functional Swarm cluster to deploy microservices.

Microservices Deployment:
a. Ask students to deploy the microservices-based application to the Docker Swarm cluster using the Docker Compose file they created.
b. Ensure that they understand how to deploy and manage stacks in Docker Swarm.

Scaling Microservices:
a. Encourage students to demonstrate how to scale individual microservices within the Swarm cluster to handle increased workloads.
b. Explain the concepts of service replicas and how to use them effectively.

Load Balancing:
a. Instruct students to set up load balancing for the microservices using Swarm's built-in load balancing capabilities or by integrating with an external load balancer.
b. Explain how load balancing helps distribute traffic among multiple service instances.

Testing and Verification:
a. Encourage students to test the microservices deployment by sending requests to the application, verifying the communication between microservices, and scaling responses.
b. Document the testing process and results.

Documentation:
a. Require students to create documentation that includes:

The Docker Compose file for the microservices.
Steps for setting up the Docker Swarm cluster.
Deployment and scaling procedures.
Testing results and observations.
Presentation (Optional):
a. Depending on your course format, students can either present their microservices deployment setup and findings to the class or submit their documentation as instructed.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Effective deployment of microservices using Docker Swarm.
Successful scaling and load balancing of microservices.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Optional presentation (if performed).
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, content quality).
