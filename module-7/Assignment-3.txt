Multi-Environment Deployment with Docker Compose

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Deploying applications to various environments, such as development, staging, and production, is a crucial skill for Docker developers. In this assignment, students will create a Docker Compose file capable of deploying an application to different environments using environment-specific configurations. They will demonstrate how to use the same Compose file for deploying to multiple environments, promoting consistency and ease of deployment.

Assignment Objectives:

To understand the importance of environment-specific configuration in multi-environment deployments.
To gain hands-on experience in creating a versatile Docker Compose file for deploying applications to different environments.
To practice managing environment-specific settings within a Docker Compose setup.
Task Description:

Introduction to Multi-Environment Deployment:
a. Provide an introduction to the significance of multi-environment deployment in Docker development.
b. Explain how environment-specific configurations help maintain consistency and simplify deployment.

Sample Application:
a. Provide students with a sample application (e.g., a web application) and its source code.
b. Ensure that the application can be configured differently for each environment (e.g., database connection settings, debug mode).

Docker Compose File Creation:
a. Instruct students to create a Docker Compose file that defines the application's services and dependencies.
b. Encourage them to design the Compose file in a way that supports deployment to multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod).

Environment-Specific Configuration:
a. Teach students how to manage environment-specific configuration by using environment variables, configuration files, or volume mounts within the Compose file.
b. Ensure they understand how to parameterize settings that may change across environments.

Deployment to Different Environments:
a. Instruct students to demonstrate how the same Docker Compose file can be used to deploy the application to different environments.
b. They should use environment-specific configurations (e.g., .env files, environment variables) to customize the deployment.

Testing and Verification:
a. Encourage students to build and deploy the application to multiple environments using the same Compose file.
b. Ask them to verify that the application runs correctly in each environment and that the environment-specific settings are applied as expected.

Documentation:
a. Require students to create documentation that includes:

The Docker Compose file.
Environment-specific configuration examples.
Steps for deploying the application to different environments.
Verification results for each environment.
Presentation (Optional):
a. Depending on your course format, students can either present their multi-environment deployment setup and findings to the class or submit their documentation as instructed.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Effective creation of a Docker Compose file for multi-environment deployment.
Successful deployment of the application to different environments.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Optional presentation (if performed).
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, content quality).
