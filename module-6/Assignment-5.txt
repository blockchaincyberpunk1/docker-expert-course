Implementing Container Isolation

Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Container isolation is a critical aspect of Docker security, ensuring that containers remain separate and secure from each other. In this assignment, students will design a scenario that requires isolating multiple containers from each other. They will create a Docker Compose file that leverages various security mechanisms, such as network segmentation and container resource limitations, to achieve isolation.

Assignment Objectives:

To understand the importance of container isolation for enhanced security.
To gain hands-on experience in configuring Docker Compose files with security mechanisms.
To apply security measures to isolate containers effectively.
Task Description:

Introduction to Container Isolation:
a. Provide an introduction to the significance of container isolation in Docker security.
b. Explain how isolation helps prevent potential security breaches and conflicts between containers.

Scenario Design:
a. Instruct students to design a scenario where multiple containers need to be isolated from each other. This could be a microservices architecture, a multi-tier application, or any other suitable scenario.
b. Encourage them to think about the specific use case and the need for isolation.

Docker Compose File Creation:
a. Ask students to create a Docker Compose file that defines the containers, their interconnections, and the required security measures.
b. Instruct them to use Docker Compose features and configuration options to implement isolation mechanisms. These may include:

Network segmentation using custom bridge networks.
Setting resource limitations (CPU, memory) for containers.
Specifying read-only file systems or volume permissions.
Leveraging security profiles or user namespaces.
Security Documentation:
a. Require students to document the security mechanisms they've employed in the Docker Compose file.
b. Explain the rationale behind each security measure and how it contributes to container isolation.

Testing and Verification:
a. Encourage students to build and run the Docker Compose scenario to test the implemented isolation.
b. Ask them to verify that containers are effectively isolated and that security measures are functioning as intended.
c. Document the testing process and results.

Presentation or Report (Optional):
a. Depending on your course format, students can either present their designed scenario and security mechanisms to the class or submit their documentation as instructed.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Effective design and implementation of container isolation measures.
Clarity and completeness of security documentation.
Successful testing and verification of isolation mechanisms.
Optional presentation (if performed).
Adherence to submission guidelines (format, content quality).
