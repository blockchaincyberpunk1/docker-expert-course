Course: Docker Developer Course

Assignment Overview:
Container security is a critical aspect of Docker development, ensuring that containers and the applications within them remain protected from vulnerabilities and threats. In this assignment, students will delve into container security best practices by researching and creating a presentation or report. They will explore topics such as user namespaces, image vulnerability scanning, and techniques for minimizing security risks.

Assignment Objectives:

To gain a comprehensive understanding of container security best practices.
To become familiar with essential security measures and techniques for Docker containers.
To communicate and present container security concepts effectively.
Task Description:

Introduction to Container Security:
